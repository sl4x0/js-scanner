# ==============================================================================
# 🦅 JS SCANNER CONFIGURATION (Hunter-Architect Edition v3.5)
# Optimized for: Linux VPS + uvloop + TaskGroup + Hybrid Discovery
# ==============================================================================

# --- TARGETING & SCOPE ---
# Global timeout for HTTP requests (per URL)
timeout: 15 # Connection timeout in seconds (reduced for fail-fast behavior)
verify_ssl: false # Keep false for bug bounty (expired certs often host dev/staging)
max_file_size: 5242880 # 5 MB max to keep scans fast for bug bounty
max_file_size_mb_download: 5.0

# --- HYBRID DISCOVERY (The Funnel) ---

# 1. SPEED LAYER: Katana (Go Binary)
# Fastest discovery. Covers 80% of surface area.
katana:
  enabled: false
  depth: 2 # shallower for faster runs
  concurrency: 20 # reduced concurrency for stable runs
  rate_limit: 150 # lower RPS conservative default
  timeout: 60 # faster fail-fast for Katana
  # Custom flags appended to default: -silent -jc -kf all
  args: "-field-scope scope" # Ensure it stays in scope (redundant safety)

# 2. HISTORY LAYER: SubJS
# passive discovery of old/orphaned files
subjs:
  enabled: true
  timeout: 60 # Increased to ensure full archive query completion

# 3. INTELLIGENCE LAYER: Playwright (Browsers)
# Deep scan for lazy-loaded code. RAM intensive.
playwright:
  headless: true
  max_concurrent: 1 # Limit browsers on VPS to avoid OOM
  restart_after: 50 # Restart frequently to prevent Chromium memory leaks
  page_timeout: 30000 # 30s timeout for slow sites (geico.com, service-now.com)
  enable_interactions: true # Toggle smart DOM interactions (set false to disable)

# Performance Optimizations
interaction_delay: 0.3 # Ultra-fast interactions - reduced from 0.5s

# --- ANALYSIS & RECURSION ---

# 4. RECURSIVE DISCOVERY (Missing in original config)
# [CRITICAL] Analysis of found JS to find *more* JS (imports, requires)
recursion:
  enabled: true
  max_depth: 2 # Depth 2 is safe. Depth 3+ can cause infinite loops/exponential explosions.
  validate_with_head: true # Check file exists (HEAD request) before downloading. Saves bandwidth.

# 5. AST & EXTRACTION
ast:
  enabled: true
  max_file_size_mb: 100 # Increased for large webpack bundles

code_splitting:
  detect_dynamic_imports: true
  extract_chunk_map: true
  probe_common_locales: ["en", "es", "fr", "de"]

# --- PERFORMANCE TUNING (High-Performance VPS Optimized) ---

# Threading (Global)
# CRITICAL: 'threads' controls ACTUAL download concurrency
# VPS-OPTIMIZED: Reduced from 200 to prevent local resource saturation and timeout queue buildup
threads: 15 # Reduced from 200 - VPS can't handle 200 concurrent connections

# Batch Processing (The heavy lifting)
batch_processing:
  enabled: true
  # Phase 4: CPU Bound Processing
  process_threads: 10 # Reduced from 100 to match VPS capacity
  cleanup_minified: false

# Download tuning - VPS-OPTIMIZED for stability over raw speed
download:
  chunk_size: 200 # Reduced from 1000 - smaller batches prevent memory pressure on VPS
  skip_preflight: true # Skip HEAD requests for maximum speed - trust the URLs are valid

# Session Management (curl_cffi HTTP Client) - MAXIMUM SPEED CONFIG
# Optimized for high-bandwidth VPS with excellent connectivity
session_management:
  pool_size: 20 # Increased from 2 - more concurrent connections for speed
  rotate_after: 500 # Increased from 100 - keep connections alive longer
  download_timeout: 30 # Increased from 8s to 30s - handle slow domains like getsentry.net

# --- SECRET SCANNING ---

trufflehog_path: "" # Auto-detect
trufflehog_timeout: 300
# CPU Bottleneck Warning: TruffleHog is heavy.
trufflehog_max_concurrent: 10 # Reduced from 50 - VPS CPU limits
