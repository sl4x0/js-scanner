# ==============================================================================
# 🦅 JS SCANNER CONFIGURATION (Hunter-Architect Edition v3.5)
# Optimized for: Linux VPS + uvloop + TaskGroup + Hybrid Discovery
# ==============================================================================

# --- TARGETING & SCOPE ---
# Global timeout for HTTP requests (per URL)
timeout: 15 # Connection timeout in seconds (reduced for fail-fast behavior)
verify_ssl: false # Keep false for bug bounty (expired certs often host dev/staging)
max_file_size: 5242880 # 5 MB max to keep scans fast for bug bounty
max_file_size_mb_download: 5.0

# --- HYBRID DISCOVERY (The Funnel) ---

# 1. SPEED LAYER: Katana (Go Binary)
# Fastest discovery. Covers 80% of surface area.
katana:
  enabled: false
  depth: 2 # shallower for faster runs
  concurrency: 20 # reduced concurrency for stable runs
  rate_limit: 150 # lower RPS conservative default
  timeout: 60 # faster fail-fast for Katana
  # Custom flags appended to default: -silent -jc -kf all
  args: "-field-scope scope" # Ensure it stays in scope (redundant safety)

# 2. HISTORY LAYER: SubJS
# passive discovery of old/orphaned files
subjs:
  enabled: true
  timeout: 60 # Increased to ensure full archive query completion

# 3. INTELLIGENCE LAYER: Playwright (Browsers)
# Deep scan for lazy-loaded code. RAM intensive.
playwright:
  headless: true
  max_concurrent: 1 # FIX: Reduced from 2 to 1 - prevents browser crash race conditions!
  restart_after: 15 # FIX: Restart more frequently (was 20) to prevent memory buildup
  page_timeout: 30000 # CPU-OPTIMIZED: Reduced from 45s to 30s for faster fail-fast
  enable_interactions: false # ✅ FIX 3: DISABLED for speed - only downloading JS, no UI testing

# Performance Optimizations
interaction_delay: 0.3 # Ultra-fast interactions - reduced from 0.5s

# --- ANALYSIS & RECURSION ---

# 4. RECURSIVE DISCOVERY (Missing in original config)
# [CRITICAL] Analysis of found JS to find *more* JS (imports, requires)
recursion:
  enabled: true
  max_depth: 1 # ✅ FIX 3: Reduced from 2 to 1 - faster scans, less overhead

# Session Management (curl_cffi HTTP Client) - MAXIMUM SPEED CONFIG
# Optimized for high-bandwidth VPS with excellent connectivity
